# GalacticUnicornScroll

Jan-Willem Ruys, December 2022

Experimenting with scrolling text on the Galactic Unicorn - after all, that's what we bought it for, or is that just me?

Text and other settings are hardcoded but easy to find in the code. 

Buttons: <br>
A/B - Change foreground color <br>
C/D - Change background color <br>
Vol - Change scroll speed <br>
Zzz - Pause scroll <br>
Lux - Change brightness

Nex stop: WiFi support?
