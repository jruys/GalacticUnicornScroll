# GalacticUnicornScroll

Jan-Willem Ruys, December 2022

Experimenting with scrolling text on the Galactic Unicorn - after all, that's what we bought it for, or is that just me?

Text and other settings are hardcoded but easy to find in the code

Buttons:
A/B - Change foreground color
C/D - Change background color
Vol - Change scroll speed
Zzz - Pause scroll
Lux - Change brightness
